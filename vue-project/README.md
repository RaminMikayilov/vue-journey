# Directives

## ðŸ§  What are Directives?

Directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element. They are prefixed with `v-` to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue.

### Common Directives:

- `v-bind`: Dynamically bind one or more attributes, or a component prop to an expression.
- `v-model`: Create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements.
- `v-if`: Conditionally render elements based on a boolean expression.
- `v-else`: Render an element if the previous `v-if` or `v-else-if` condition is false.
- `v-else-if`: Add an else-if condition to a previous `v-if`.
- `v-show`: Toggle the visibility of an element based on a boolean expression.
- `v-for`: Render a list of items by iterating over an array or object.
- `v-on`: Attach event listeners to elements.
- `v-slot`: Define a slot for a component.
